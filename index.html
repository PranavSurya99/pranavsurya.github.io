<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<section id="about" class="section reveal">
<div class="card">
<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am a public policy researcher with training in economics and applied policy analysis.
My academic background includes a Master’s in Public Policy from IIT Tirupati and a
Bachelor’s in Economics (Honours) from Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning,
Prasanthi Nilayam.
</p>

<p>
My interests focus on how public institutions design, finance, and implement programs
that shape economic security, service delivery, and welfare outcomes. I am particularly
interested in social protection systems, municipal finance, and the use of data and
evaluation frameworks to improve policy effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
I have hands-on research experience through my internship at the Institute for Social
and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, where I contributed to large-scale climate advisory
programs, policy reports, and monitoring frameworks impacting millions of beneficiaries.
